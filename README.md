# Serial Scraper
 Scrapes the contents of a web serial into a SQLite database, to then run complicated queries on it.

 Began life as an answer to the question "What's the wordcount of 'The Gods Are Bastards' by D.D. Webb?" before I realized that, with the power of the many SQL courses I've had to take in college, I could potentially ask and answer MUCH more complicated and interesting questions than that. So I looked up the Python SQLite documentation, put on a pot of coffee, and three hours later, this baby was born.
